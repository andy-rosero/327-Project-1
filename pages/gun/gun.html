<p>You raise your rifle before your ghost even finishes calling out to you, pulling the trigger for a split second as several shots ring out of the automatic weapon. The dreg crumples to the ground, dead in front of you. 
</p>
<p>“Nice shot guardian!” your ghost says as he materializes beside you, “I definitely chose the right person for the job. Now let's go, the ship’s signature isn’t that far ahead.” 
</p>
<p>The two of you continue into the adjoining room, this one much bigger than the last. Suspended at the center of the room is what looks like a ship, hanging on only by wires. 
</p>
<p>“Last City here we come” the Ghost chirps, “Let me just dust off my hot-wiring skills.” </p>

<p>The ghost dematerializes into the ship. Within a minute, the ship becomes the second thing to come alive today. Centuries-old technology begins whirring and beeping, a loud groan of the engine kicking back momentarily as it hums to life. 
</p>
<p>You feel a tug in your core as your ghost teleports you into the cockpit. 
</p>

<p>“Driving lessons later. I can get us there safely. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.”
