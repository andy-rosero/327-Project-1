<p>Death doesn’t feel like death. You seem to be swimming underwater but you still can breathe, like you’ve been suspended in some kind of vat. The feeling doesn’t last, as you are resuscitated for the second time that day. A figure comes into view and offers a gloved hand. 
</p>
<p>“That vandal really rang your bell, huh, new light?” a charming male voice chimes, “I figured if I checked my stashes I’d run into newbies.” 
</p>
<p>You take his hand and stand up, your savior coming into focus. A blue robot with bluer glowing eyes makes an attempt to wink at you and salutes you, a handgun emblazoned with a spade in hand. 
</p>
<p>“Name’s Cayde-6. I guess if I found you, it’s my job to get your newly hatched duckling butt to the city safe. We’ll take my ride.” 
</p>
<p>He places a hand on your shoulder as you feel a tug on your stomach as you both are teleported into the cockpit of the ship. 
</p>
<p>“Hope you like golden age rock, that’s all I got on this ship” </p>
