<p>Against your ghost’s recommendation, you head in the direction of the stranger. “Guardian, we have to go find the ship” 
</p>
<p>Ignoring your ghost’s protests. You stay your course, not wanting to follow the directions of the strange entity who claims to have found you. “Guardian if you would just list-” The ghost’s voice trails off as you tune it out, attempting to find the strange figure that was watching you. 
</p>
<p>Eventually, you come to a clearing among the rusted cars where you find the stranger standing with her back to you, holding their fingers to their ear as if receiving communications. 
</p>
<p>“Yes, the guardian spotted me, but I’m sure that I’ve shaken them off my trail” 
</p>
<p>Before you can even interject, the Stranger whips around and points a weapon at you. They realize who you are, relax, and lower their aim. 
</p>
<p>“At least I thought so,” She begins, “You can’t meet me yet, that’s not part of the plan” 
</p>
<p>Faster than you can react, she teleports right in front of you and shoves her palm into your chest, channeling some kind of energy into you as your sight becomes engulfed in white.
