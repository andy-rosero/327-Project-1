<p>You come to, for the second time today, on the floor of what seems to be a hangar. The hangar workers watch this unfold, then look over to your ghost. Their faces are momentarily tense in surprise, but upon seeing the ghost, go back to their work, seemingly unfazed by the spontaneous teleportation.
</p>
<p>“I don’t have an explanation for that” the ghost remarks, finally speaking up since the interaction with the stranger, “but what I do know is that we’re in the City.”
</p>
<p>You stand up and look out the hangar bay, seeing a large sphere with a bustling city beneath. Somehow, you are in your new home now
