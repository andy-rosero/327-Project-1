<p>“Guardian?”</p>

<p>You hear a voice pierce what you thought was an eternal silence. No. It can’t be.</p>

<p>“Guardian, do you hear me?”</p> 

<p>The voice pierces the darkness again, as light begins to gradually flood your peripheral vision, then finally overtakes your eyes. It’s almost as if you are being born. Again.</p> 

<p>“Eyes up guardian!”</p> 

<p>Your vision finally adjusts to the light as you come to, your rouser slowly focusing into view. A floating object comes into your line of sight, shaped like a weird christmas ornament with one diamond-shaped eye. </p>

<p>“Oh. Thank the Traveler you woke up. I’ve been looking for you for ages”</p> 

<p>You take a deep breath through lungs that seem like it hasn’t taken a breath in its existence before you scan your surroundings. A sea of rusted corpses of cars surround you, as if frozen in a mad dash to the wall towering behind you. You wonder who you are, and what is this little thing that says it's been looking for you.</p>

<p>“I don’t have time for the typical orientation, we need to go. Now.” The little ornament continues, “Just know that I am a ghost. Your Ghost.” The ghost looks around frantically, as multiple howls of unknown origin echo in the distance, “Those things you just heard are not nice, nor are they looking to make new friends. I’ve scanned the area and picked up the signature of an abandoned jumpship within the wall behind us that I can hotwire to just barely get us to the City, and then we can answer your questions. At least nod if you understand.” </p>

<p>You nod out of instinct as you take one final scan of the immediate vicinity when something, no someone, catches your eye. A slender figure in a hood in the distance, standing so still as if she was observing you. They appear to flinch and look in your direction for a split second, noticing your glance. She darts off farther away, parallel to the large wall.</p>

<p>Your ghost’s voice interrupts the silent exchange, “Guardian we need to get moving. That ship isn't going to be there long with scavengers in the area.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>
